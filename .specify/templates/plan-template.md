# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. For Python CLI projects, ensure all fields are concrete.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Primary Dependencies**: click/typer for CLI, gitpython for git operations (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Configuration**: TOML/YAML config files, environment variables (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Testing**: pytest (optional but recommended) (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows CLI (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Project Type**: single (Python CLI application)
**CLI Design**: Command structure, subcommands, argument/option patterns (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Git Integration**: Read/write git config, scope (system/global/local) (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Performance Goals**: <100ms for config reads, <500ms for complex operations (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Constraints**: No external services, local git operations only (or NEEDS CLARIFICATION)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Principle I - Clarity Over Brevity**:

- [ ] All placeholders include examples or guidance comments
- [ ] Technical terms are defined on first use
- [ ] Ambiguities documented as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION"

**Principle II - User Story Independence**:

- [ ] Each user story in spec.md has explicit priority (P1, P2, P3)
- [ ] Each user story has Given-When-Then acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each user story documents standalone value delivery

**Principle III - CLI-First Design**:

- [ ] All features expose CLI commands or subcommands
- [ ] CLI follows UNIX conventions (stdin/stdout/stderr)
- [ ] All commands support --help flag
- [ ] Output supports both human-readable and machine-parseable formats
- [ ] Exit codes follow standard conventions

**Principle IV - Template Consistency**:

- [ ] All placeholders follow `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]` convention
- [ ] Section ordering follows: Summary → Context → Check → Structure → Phases
- [ ] File paths are absolute and match chosen project structure

**Principle V - Specification Completeness**:

- [ ] spec.md exists and passed checklist validation
- [ ] All "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items from spec.md resolved or documented as deferred
- [ ] Technical context section has no unanswered constraints

**Complexity Justification**: [Required if any above checks fail - document principle violated,
reason, mitigation strategy, and remediation timeline. Otherwise state: "No violations - all gates passed."]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
